# WebSSH Bridge Architecture

## System Overview

The WebSSH Bridge implements a high-performance, enterprise-grade WebSocket-to-SSH gateway using modern Go concurrency patterns. The system provides secure SSH connections through web browsers with advanced features including connection management, rate limiting, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Core Architecture

### Channel-Based Coordination System

The system employs a channel-based coordination architecture that eliminates traditional mutex synchronization in favor of a single coordinator goroutine pattern. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Single Point of Coordination**: All state changes flow through a centralized coordinator
- **Elimination of Race Conditions**: Sequential processing prevents concurrent access issues
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces context switching and lock contention
- **Enhanced Debuggability**: Centralized state management simplifies troubleshooting

### Connection Manager

The `ConnectionManager` serves as the central orchestrator for all WebSocket-SSH sessions:

```go
type ConnectionManager struct {
    config           *config.Configuration
    logger           *logrus.Logger
    operationChan    chan ManagerOperation  // Central coordination channel
    shutdownChan     chan struct{}
    globalBufferPool *BufferPool            // Memory optimization
    sessionPool      sync.Pool
    // Internal state (managed by coordinator)
    activeSessions   map[string]*BridgeSession
    hostConnections  map[string]int
    // Statistics
    totalSessions      int64
    successfulSessions int64
    failedSessions     int64
}
```

### Operation Types

The system defines strongly-typed operations for thread-safe communication:

```go
type ManagerOpType int

const (
    OpAddSession ManagerOpType = iota
    OpRemoveSession
    OpGetSession
    OpGetStats
    OpUpdateStats
    OpCheckLimits
    OpShutdown
)
```

## Memory Management

### Buffer Pool Implementation

The system implements tiered memory pools to optimize allocation patterns:

```go
type BufferPool struct {
    smallPool  sync.Pool  // < 4KB buffers
    mediumPool sync.Pool  // 4KB-16KB buffers
    largePool  sync.Pool  // > 16KB buffers
}
```

Benefits:

- Reduces garbage collection pressure
- Improves allocation performance for repeated operations
- Automatically sizes buffers based on usage patterns

### Message Pool

Structured message pooling for WebSocket and control messages:

```go
type MessagePool struct {
    wsMessagePool     sync.Pool
    controlSignalPool sync.Pool
}
```

## Session State Management

### Atomic State Machine

Sessions utilize an atomic state machine for thread-safe state transitions:

```go
type SessionState int32

const (
    StateCreated SessionState = iota
    StateConnecting
    StateActive
    StateClosing
    StateClosed
)
```

State transitions are managed through compare-and-swap operations, ensuring consistency without mutex overhead.

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Session created with `StateCreated`
2. **Connection**: Transitions to `StateConnecting` during SSH handshake
3. **Active**: Reaches `StateActive` when communication bridge is established
4. **Cleanup**: Transitions through `StateClosing` to `StateClosed`

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks

Current system performance metrics:

```
Operation Performance:
- GetStats: 2,264 ns/op
- CheckLimits: 2,068 ns/op
- AddRemoveSession: 4,724 ns/op

- BufferPool: 87.73 ns/op
- MessagePool: 10.91 ns/op
```

### Concurrency

The system handles high concurrency through:

- Lock-free state operations using atomic primitives
- Channel-based coordination preventing contention
- Memory pools reducing allocation overhead
- Efficient session lifecycle management

## Security Features
