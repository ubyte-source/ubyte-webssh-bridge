# Frontend based on xterm.js

This directory contains the frontend part of our application, which utilizes the powerful `xterm.js` library to provide a fully functional terminal in the web browser.

## About xterm.js

[xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) is an open-source library that enables developers to integrate a full-featured terminal into their web applications. It's highly customizable and supports a wide range of features, including themes, addons, and accessibility support, making it the perfect choice for building web-based terminal applications or interfaces.

## Contribution and Acknowledgements

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the developers and contributors of `xterm.js` for their invaluable work. The `xterm.js` project has significantly simplified the process of implementing a web-based terminal, and its extensive documentation and community support have been instrumental in the development of our frontend.

The `xterm.js` library is the cornerstone of our application's terminal functionality, providing users with a seamless and interactive experience that closely mirrors that of a native terminal.

## Usage

The frontend utilizes `xterm.js` to create a terminal instance attached to the DOM element specified in the HTML. Communication between the terminal and the backend is facilitated through WebSocket, enabling real-time interaction with the SSH server.
